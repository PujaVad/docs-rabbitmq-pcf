This topic provides information for RabbitMQ for PCF operators to help with
compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
For more information about GDPR and personal data in PCF, see
[General Data Protection Regulation](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/gdpr.html).

The topic describes locations where RabbitMQ for PCF might store personal data, and
actions you can take to control this data.

## <a id="personal-data"></a> Personal Data in RabbitMQ for PCF

Pivotal recommends that you strictly control personally identifiable information
used to interact with RabbitMQ for PCF.
This information might be stored in the following locations:

* [Queues](#queues)
* [Logs](#logs)

You should also control access to your RabbitMQ servers, RabbitMQ management commands, and the management console.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>:
	For a list of the locations that personal data might be stored throughout PCF, see
	<a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/gdpr.html#personal-data">
		Where Personal Data May Reside</a></p>

## <a id="queues"></a> Queues

RabbitMQ for PCF does not know if any message contains personally identifiable information.
If you use RabbitMQ for PCF to send personally identifiable information,
you should take appropriate safeguards to protect that information.

RabbitMQ stores messages, including message headers, in memory and on disk until they are consumed.
The following are actions you can take to comply with the GDPR:

* Monitor your queues to ensure the following:
    * Messages are consumed in a timely manner.
    * You are managing the lifecycle of messages containing personally identifiable
    according to your data protection policies.

* Consider using non-durable messages and setting a time to live (TTL) to limit the lifespan of messages.

## <a id="logs"></a> Logs

### <a id="haproxy-logs"></a> HAProxy Logs

RabbitMQ for PCF uses HAProxy as a load balancer for the pre-provisioned service.
The log may contain IP addresses.
These are contained in the file `/var/vcap/sys/log/rabbitmq-haproxy/haproxy.log` on an haproxy VM.

To empty the contents of an haproxy log, run the command:

```
/var/vcap/sys/log/rabbitmq-haproxy/haproxy.log
```

### <a id="server-logs"></a> RabbitMQ Server Logs

The RabbitMQ server logs may contain IP addresses.
The log files are stored on rabbitmq-server VMs in the directory `/var/vcap/sys/log/rabbitmq-server`.
For information about RabbitMQ server logs, see [Logging](https://www.rabbitmq.com/logging.html)
in the RabbitMQ documentation.
