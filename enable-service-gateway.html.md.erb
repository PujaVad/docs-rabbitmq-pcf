title: Enabling Service-Gateway Access (Beta)
owner: RabbitMQ
---

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

[Service-Gateway access](./service-gateway-access.html) enables a RabbitMQ service instance to connect to
external components that are not on the same <%= vars.platform_name %> foundation as the RabbitMQ service.

To enable Service-Gateway access for an on-demand offering:
1. [Enable TCP routing using the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile](#tcp-routing)
1. [Configure the load balancer in the IaaS to redirect traffic to the TCP router](#configure-lb)
1. [Create a DNS record that resolves to the load balancer](#create-dns-record)
1. [Configure a Service-Gateway-enabled plan](#configure-service-gateway-plan)

<p class="note warning">
  <strong>Warning:</strong> Pivotal recommends that you configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) alongside
   Service-Gateway access to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
  For instructions on how to configure TLS, see <a href="./install-config.html#security">Configure Security</a>.
</p>

## <a id='configuration'></a> Enable Service-Gateway Access

### <a id='tcp-routing'></a>1. Enable TCP Routing Using the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Tile

TCP routing is disabled by default. To enable TCP routing:

1. Go to the Networking pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.
1. Under **Enable TCP requests to apps through specific ports on the TCP router**, select
**Enable TCP routing**.
1. For TCP routing ports, enter one or more ports to which the load balancer forwards requests.
For example, `1024` for a single port or `1024â€“1123` for a range of ports.
1. Apply changes in <%= vars.ops_manager %> for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile to create the TCP router.
1. From the status tab of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile, make note of the CID <%# Add CID to Style Checker %> of the TCP router.

### <a id='configure-lb'></a> 2. Configure the Load Balancer in the IaaS to Redirect Traffic to the TCP Router
1. Find the VM instance using your IaaS console for TCP router using the CID that you noted down earlier.
1. Following the documentation for your IaaS, create an external TCP Load Balancer which points to the TCP
router VM found above.
1. Configure a new external port range that does not overlap with the TCP networking port or port range you
configured earlier in [step 1](#tcp-routing).
For example, if your TCP routing port range is `1024-1123` then your load balancer port range must not be `1000-1100`.
   <p class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> Each RabbitMQ service instance using Service-Gateway access requires a unique port.
        Ensure that the port range configured above has enough capacity to accommodate the maximum number of
        service instances desired.
   </p>
1. Note down this port range.

### <a id='create-dns-record'></a> 3. Create a DNS Record That Resolves to the Load Balancer
1. Following the documentation for your IaaS, create a new DNS record of type A that resolves to the external
IP address of the load balancer created in [step 2](#configure-lb) above.
1. Note down the domain used for this DNS record.

### <a id='configure-service-gateway-plan'></a> 4. Configure a Service-Gateway-Enabled Plan
1. In **Global Settings for On-Demand Plans**, fill in the following fields:
    - **External TCP domain**: Corresponding with the DNS entry for the external load balancer, noted in
    [step 3](#create-dns-record).
    - **Port Range**: A range of ports configured in external load balancer for RabbitMQ service instances to
    use, noted in [step 2](#configure-lb).

    ![Example of the Global Settings for On-demand Plans pane.
    The External TCP domain field has tcp.elcajon.cf-app.com. The Port Range field has 1024&ndash;2025.]
    (/images/global-settings-service-gateway.png)

     <p class="note warning">
       <strong>Warning:</strong> Future modifications to this range must include ports that are already
       assigned to service instances.
       If a service instance is using a port that is no longer within the range, service instance upgrades fail.
       For example, if Service-Gateway Access was previously set up with a port range of <code>1000-1005</code>
       and service instances were created corresponding to ports <code>1000</code>, <code>1001</code> and
       <code>1002</code>, the new port range configured must contain <code>1000</code>, <code>1001</code> and
       <code>1002</code> ports.
     </p>

1. Navigate to the service plan that you want to use and select the **Service-Gateway Access** checkbox.
    <p class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> Pivotal recommends that you change the name or the description of the plan to
      indicate that Service-Gateway access is enabled for that plan.
    </p>

    ![Service plan pane with the Service-Gateway Access checkbox selected.](/images/enable-service-gateway.png)

    <p class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> If Service-Gateway access is disabled and then re-enabled, app developers must
      create new service keys to obtain a new set of credentials for Service-Gateway access.
    </p>

1. In <%= vars.ops_manager %>, apply changes for the RabbitMQ tile.
