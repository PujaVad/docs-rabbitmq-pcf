The <%= vars.ops_manager %> API invokes CredHub Maestro when rotating certificates.
If a certificate rotation API command is unsafe, CredHub Maestro stops the command
and returns one or more safety violations.

For example, performing steps out of the correct order during certificate rotations
can make your deployment unstable or risk downtime.

For information about how to troubleshoot safety violation errors that are returned
when rotating certificates, see [Troubleshooting CredHub Maestro Safety Violations
During Certificate Rotation](troubleshoot-cert-errors.html).
