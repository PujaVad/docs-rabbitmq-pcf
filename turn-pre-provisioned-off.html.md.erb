This topic provides instructions on how to turn off the pre-provisioned service.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> The pre-provisioned service
will be deprecated in a future release. Pivotal recommends using the on-demand
service for new deployments. For instructions, see <a href="./install-config.html">
Installing and Configuring the On-Demand Service</a>.</p>

If you are not planning to use the pre-provisioned service, disable it.
Disabling the pre-provisioned service broker means that no instances for the
pre-provisioned service will be deployed.  This, in turn, saves money.

To turn off the pre-provisioned service manually, do the following:

1. If you are upgrading to RabbitMQ for PCF v1.14, or have previously configured the pre-provisioned service,
de-register the pre-provisioned service broker by running the following command:

    ```
    bosh -d p-rabbitmq-GUID run-errand broker-deregistrar
    ```

    Where is `GUID` is the RabbitMQ for PCF deployment GUID.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -d p-rabbitmq-aeaea3ac-aba5-a6a4-afa7-aba8a0a7a0a9 run-errand broker-deregistrar</pre>

    The broker-deregistrar  errand removes the `p-rabbitmq` service offering from the Marketplace.

2. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the RabbitMQ tile.

3. In the RabbitMQ tile, click **Settings**.

4. Click **Pre-Provisioned RabbitMQ**, and click **No** under the **Deploy Pre-Provisioned service offering**.

    ![pre-provisioned rabbitmq pane shows deploy pre-provisioned service yes no radio button](pre-provision-turn-off-service.png)

1. Click **Save**, and then return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. If you are using Ops Manager v2.3 or later, click **Review Pending Changes**.
   For more information about this Ops Manager page,
   see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).

1. Click **Apply Changes** to redeploy and disable the pre-provisioned service.

=======
## <a id="automation"></a> Disable the Pre-Provisioned Service Using Automation

If you are using automation, such as scripts or pipelines, to configure the
RabbitMQ for PCF tile, perform the following steps to disable the pre-provisioned service:

1. Set the `.properties.multitenant_support` property to `disabled`.
Ops Manager automatically sets the instance counts to <code>0</code> if
<code>.properties.multitenant_support</code> is set to <code>disabled</code>.

1. For instance groups related to the pre-provisioned service,
such as `rabbitmq-server`, `rabbitmq-broker`, `rabbitmq-haproxy`,
either set the instance count to `0` or do not set an instance count.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong>
  Although the fields are inactive in the user interface, this does not prevent you
  from overwriting instance counts through the API.
  If you modify instance counts to a non-zero value, BOSH fails to deploy the tile.
  This is because BOSH tries to create the VMs but does not have the required properties.</p>
