## <a id="1-18-1"></a> v1.18.1

**Release Date**: December 12, 2019

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* Operators can configure an on-demand plan that enables service instances to connect to components outside
the <%= vars.platform_name %> foundation through AMQP.
For more information, see [Enabling Service-Gateway Access (Beta)](./service-gateway-access.html).
This functionality is planned for other supported protocols in later releases.
* This release uses RabbitMQ 3.8. For more information, see the [repository](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.8.0) in GitHub.
* This version supports quorum queues. For more information about quorum queues, see the
[RabbitMQ documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html).
* Previously, operators could not set an upper limit on the number of on-demand service instances higher than 200.
This restriction has been removed.

<p class="note warning">
  <strong>Warning:</strong> Usernames and passwords are removed from the RabbitMQ dashboard URL in a service
  binding because of a potential XSS vector.
  For more information, see this <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/pull/748">pull request</a>
  in GitHub.<br><br>
  This means users are no longer automatically logged in when navigating to the dashboard URL.
  Instead, the user must explicitly enter their username and password on the RabbitMQ dashboard login page.
</p>

### Known Issue

When used in production, quorum queues might experience downtime during a rolling upgrade.
