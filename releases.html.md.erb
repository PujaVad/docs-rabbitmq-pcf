## <a id="upgrade"></a> Upgrade to the Latest Version

Pivotal recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line,
then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line.
For example, if you use an older v1.14.x version,
upgrade to the latest v1.14.x version before upgrading to the latest v1.15.x version.

For product versions and upgrade paths,
see the [Product Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf).

## <a id="1160"></a> v1.16.0

**Release Date**: Month DD, YYYY

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong>
To fix CVE-2018-1279, the method used to generate the Erlang cookie has changed in RabbitMQ for PCF v1.16.
For more information about this security issue, see
<a href="https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-1279">CVE-2018-1279: RabbitMQ cluster compromise due to deterministically generated cookie</a>.
<br><br>
If you rely on the tile to generate the cookie by leaving the Erlang cookie field
blank, you will experience a few minutes of downtime when you upgrade.
For more information, see <a href="./install-config-pp.html#security-fix">Erlang Cookie Security Fix</a>.
<br><br>
If you have set the cookie explicitly in the tile configuration, you are not
affected by this issue or this change.</p>

### Security Fixes

This release includes the following security fix:

* High [CVE-2018-1279: RabbitMQ cluster compromise due to deterministically generated cookie](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-1279)

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* A checkbox on the plan configuration page lets you specify that the plan is a paid-type plan.
  In previous versions, all RabbitMQ for PCF plans were marked as free in the Marketplace.
  For information about how to mark that a plan is a paid plan,
  see [Configure the Service Plan](install-config.html#service-plan).

* You can enable the `rabbitmq_event_exchange` and the `rabbitmq_mqtt` plugins in on-demand service instances,
  which are disabled by default.
  For how to do this, see [Disabled RabbitMQ Server Plugins](./install-config.html#disabled-plugins).

### Resolved Issues

This release fixes the following issues:

* Cluster scaling no longer requires downtime because the Erlang cookie is
generated using a different method.

### Known Issues

This release has the following known issues:

* Changing the Erlang Cookie value requires cluster downtime, and can result in
failed deployments.
For more information about this issue, see [Changing the Erlang Cookie Value Known Issue](./install-config-pp.html#changing-issue).
