## <a id="upgrade"></a> Upgrade to the Latest Version

Pivotal recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line,
then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line.
For example, if you use an older v1.11.x version,
upgrade to the latest v1.11.x version before upgrading to the latest v1.12.x version.

For product versions and upgrade paths,
see the [Product Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Pivotal no longer recommends waiting for
  Spring Cloud Services (SCS) v3.0, where the dependency on pre-provisioned RabbitMQ
  for PCF will be removed, before upgrading from RabbitMQ for PCF v1.12 to v1.13.
  This is due to the risk of going out of support on your RabbitMQ for PCF tile,
  Pivotal Application Service (PAS), and other components. </p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>:
  Pivotal recommends upgrading from RabbitMQ for PCF v1.12.x to v1.13.x on PCF v2.1 or on PCF v2.2.6 or later.
</p>

## <a id="use-new-plans"></a> Use RabbitMQ v3.7 On-Demand Plans

RabbitMQ v3.7 plans are available.
Ensure that all apps use the RabbitMQ v3.7 on-demand plans instead of the RabbitMQ v3.6 on-demand plans.
