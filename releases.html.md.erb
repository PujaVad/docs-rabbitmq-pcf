## <a id="2-1-x"></a> v2.1.x

**Release Date**: May 17, 2022

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* **TAS 2.13 Support:**: New changes to the log collection architecture within TAS required
changes to our product in order to support existing metrics flows. These changes to TAS 2.13 have
also been backported to TAS 2.12. As a result VMWare Tanzu RabbitMQ for VMs versions 2.0.x and below will
only be compatible with TAS 2.12 and below. If you are upgrading your TAS installation to 2.13, you MUST
also upgrade VMware Tanzu RabbitMQ for VMs to version 2.1.x.

* **RabbitMQ 3.9:** RabbitMQ 3.9 is now the default installed version. On-Demand instances
that are currently running RabbitMQ version 3.8 will be upgraded to
RabbitMQ 3.9 if you run the `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand
when installing this releease.

Important changes in RabbitMQ 3.9 include Streams, Erlang 24 support and
JSON logging. For more information on the specifics of these features see
the [RabbitMQ 3.9 release page](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.9.17)
