## <a id="1-20-1"></a> v1.20.1

**Release Date**: September 09, 2020

### Features

This release bumps the major version of Erlang used by service instances to 23.

### Resolved Issues

This release fixes the following issues:
- **On-demand-adapter does not cleanly exit the drain script when the credentials are not present in UAA:** the drain script is expected 
  to output just an integer to determine success (0) or failure (non-zero). In some cases, it was outputting some errors, even though the
      operation had the desired outcome, causing a failure in the drain operation

### Known Issues

This release has the following known issues:

## <a id="1-20-0"></a> v1.20.0

**Release Date**: August 21, 2020

### Features

New features in this release:

* **Syslog forwarding:** <%= vars.ops_manager %> now manages <%= vars.product_short %> syslog
configuration.
This improvement does not affect syslog configuration for within the tile.
However, for new service instances the default program name is different.
To learn how to configure syslog to keep the log format consistent, see
[Configure Syslog Forwarding](./monitor.html#config)

* **BOSH Hot Swap:** To reduce downtime, on-demand service instances created using
<%= vars.product_short %> v1.20 and later use the `vm_strategy` `create-swap-delete`.
During deployment, IaaS resource usage surges while BOSH creates additional VMs to prepare for
the update. You might need to review resource limits for your IaaS and account.
If your limits are too low, your deployment fails.<br>
On-demand service instances that were created using <%= vars.product_short %> v1.19 or earlier
and upgraded to v1.20 or later continue to use the `vm_strategy` `delete-create`.<br>
For more information about how this affects downtime, see
[BOSH Hot Swap](./upgrade.html#vm-strategy).

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/services/you-can-upgrade-one-si' %>

* **OAuth:** Support for the RabbitMQ OAuth plugin has now arrived in <%= vars.product_short %>.
Users can authenticate with the RabbitMQ Management UI through JWT-encoded OAuth 2.0
access tokens.
For more information about the plugin, see
[rabbitmq-auth-backend-oauth2](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-oauth2) in GitHub.
For how to enable OAuth in <%= vars.product_short %>, see [Enabling OAuth](./enable-oauth.html).
