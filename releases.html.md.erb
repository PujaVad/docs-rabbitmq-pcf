## <a id="upgrade"></a> Upgrade to the Latest Version

Pivotal recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line,
then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line.
For example, if you use an older v1.13.x version,
upgrade to the latest v1.13.x version before upgrading to the latest v1.14.x version.

For product versions and upgrade paths,
see the [Product Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf).

## <a id="deprecation"></a> Pre-Provisioned Service to be Deprecated

The pre-provisioned service will be deprecated in a future release. The details
will be announced over the next few months.  Pivotal recommends using the
on-demand service for new deployments.

Teams who currently use procedures in
[Isolating Clusters with the RabbitMQ for PCF Replicator](./replicator.html) will be affected
by the deprecation of the pre-preprovisioned service and should start planning for this now.

For information about migrating from the pre-provisioned service to the on-demand
service, see
[About Migrating a Pre-Provisioned Instance to an On-Demand Instance](./ondemand.html#migrating-from-mt).
For instructions on how to install, configure, and deploy RabbitMQ for PCF
as an on-demand service, see <a href="./install-config.html">
