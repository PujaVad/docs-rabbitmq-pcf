## <a id="upgrade"></a> Upgrade to the Latest Version

Pivotal recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line,
then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line.
For example, if you use an older v1.16.x version,
upgrade to the latest v1.16.x version before upgrading to the latest v1.17.x version.

For product versions and upgrade paths,
see the [Product Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf).

## <a id="1170"></a> v1.17.0

**Release Date**: MMMM DD, 2019

<p class="note warning"> <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>:
  If you are upgrading from v1.16.4 or earlier, you will experience a
  <strong>small window of downtime</strong> during the upgrade to RabbitMQ for PCF v1.17.
  This is because the RabbitMQ cluster is taken offline and each node is upgraded to Erlang v21.
  To minimize the impact of this downtime, Pivotal recommends that you notify app owners before upgrading.</p>
