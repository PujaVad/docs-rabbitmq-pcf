## <a id="upgrade"></a> Upgrade to the Latest Version

Pivotal recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line,
then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line.
For example, if you use an older v1.12.x version,
upgrade to the latest v1.12.x version before upgrading to the latest v1.13.x version.

For product versions and upgrade paths,
see the [Product Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Pivotal no longer recommends waiting for
  Spring Cloud Services (SCS) v3.0, where the dependency on pre-provisioned RabbitMQ
  for PCF will be removed, before upgrading from RabbitMQ for PCF v1.12 to v1.13.
  This is due to the risk of going out of support on your RabbitMQ for PCF tile,
  Pivotal Application Service (PAS), and other components. </p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>:
  It is only possible to upgrade from RabbitMQ for PCF v1.12.7+ to v1.13.x on PCF v2.2.6 or later.
</p>


## <a id="deprecation"></a> Pre-Provisioned Service to be Deprecated

The pre-provisioned service will be deprecated in a future release. The details
will be announced over the next few months.  Pivotal recommends using the
on-demand service for new deployments.

Teams who currently use procedures in
[Isolating Clusters with the RabbitMQ for PCF Replicator](./replicator.html) will be affected
by the deprecation of the pre-provisioned service and should start planning for this now.

For information about migrating from the pre-provisioned service to the on-demand
service, see
[About Migrating a Pre-Provisioned Instance to an On-Demand Instance](./ondemand.html#migrating-from-mt).
For instructions on how to install, configure, and deploy RabbitMQ for PCF
as an on-demand service, see <a href="./install-config.html">
Installing and Configuring RabbitMQ for PCF the On-Demand Service</a>.

**Release Date**: November 22, 2018

### Security Fixes

  on the loggregator firehose.
  This issue does not affect new installations.

* You cannot upgrade from RabbitMQ for PCF v1.12 to v1.13 on PCF v2.2.0 - v2.2.5.
  You must upgrade on PCF v2.1 or on PCF v2.2.6 or later.

* If you are upgrading RabbitMQ for PCF v1.12 to v1.13 and you use Spring Cloud Services,
  you must disable all errands in the Spring Cloud Services tile during the upgrade to ensure that the upgrade succeeds.

* Cluster scaling or changing the Erlang cookie value require cluster downtime
  and might result in failed deployments. For more information, see [Erlang Cookie](./install-config-pp.html#erlang),

## <a id="1130"></a> v1.13.0

**Release Date**: July 20, 2018

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* Supports securing communication between apps and on-demand
service instances using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
For more information, see [Preparing for TLS](./prepare-tls.html).
For ease of upgrade from previous versions, this functionality is turned off by default.

* Includes open source RabbitMQ v3.7.
  This version includes many improvements.
  For information about what is new in RabbitMQ v3.7,
  see the [RabbitMQ documentation](http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2018/02/05/whats-new-in-rabbitmq-3-7/).
  The path to upgrade the pre-provisioned service to v3.7 requires manual intervention,
  and the path to upgrade the on-demand service requires removing preexisting instances.
  For information, see [Upgrading RabbitMQ for PCF](upgrade.html).

* Smoke tests for the on-demand broker now use the system org, as is already the case for multi-tenant.

### Known Issues

This release has the following known issues:

* You cannot upgrade from PCF v.12 to PCF v1.13 on PCF v2.2.0 - v2.2.5.
  You must upgrade on PCF v2.1 or on PCF v2.2.6 or later.

* If you are upgrading RabbitMQ for PCF v1.12 to v1.13 and you use Spring Cloud Services,
  you must disable all errands in the Spring Cloud Services tile during the upgrade to ensure that the upgrade succeeds.

* Cluster scaling or changing the [Erlang Cookie](./install-config-pp.html#erlang) value require cluster downtime,
  and might result in failed deployments.
  For more information, see [Cluster Scaling Known Issue](./install-config-pp.html#scaling-issue) and
[Changing the Erlang Cookie Value Known Issue](./install-config-pp.html#changing-issue).

  Pivotal recommends leaving the default run rule set to **On**.

* When on-demand service instances are enabled for TLS, the `port` property in
  `VCAP_SERVICES` for `amqp+ssl` incorrectly reports that the port is `5672`.
  The actual port used for `amqp+ssl` is `5671`.
