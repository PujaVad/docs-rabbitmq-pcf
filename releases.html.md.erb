## <a id="upgrade"></a> Upgrade to the Latest Version

Pivotal recommends upgrading from the latest v1.15 release to the latest v1.17 release. You can skip v1.16 in this case to save time and take advantage of the latest features.

Pivotal discourages any other upgrade path that skips a release, such as v1.14 to v1.16, as they are untested.

Because v1.17 contains a new version of Erlang, upgrading to v1.17 from any previous version requires a
cluster shutdown. The service is unavailable while the cluster upgrades. After the final node upgrades, the
cluster starts and the service is available again.

For product versions and upgrade paths,
see the [Product Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf).
