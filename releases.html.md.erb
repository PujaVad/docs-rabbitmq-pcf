## <a id="1-17-3"></a> v1.17.3

**Release Date**: October 11, 2019

### Security Fixes

This release includes the following security fixes:

* Critical [CVE-2019-9512](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9512):
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to ping floods, potentially leading to a denial of service.
The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses.
Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.

* Critical [CVE-2019-9514](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9514):
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially leading to a denial of service.
The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request over each stream
that should solicit a stream of RST\_STREAM frames from the peer.
Depending on how the peer queues the RST\_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.

* Critical [CVE-2019-9515](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9515):
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a settings flood, potentially leading to a denial of service.
The attacker sends a stream of SETTINGS frames to the peer. Because the RFC requires
that the peer reply with one acknowledgement per SETTINGS frame, an empty SETTINGS
frame is almost equivalent in behavior to a ping. Depending on how efficiently this
data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.

* The update to OSS RabbitMQ v3.7.18 includes a security fix.
For more information about RabbitMQ v3.7.18, see the [RabbitMQ Changelog](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html).

### Features

  * OSS RabbitMQ to v3.7.18
  * Erlang to v21.3.8.7
  * HAProxy to v1.8.21

### Known Issues
