## <a id="1-19-1"></a> v1.19.1

**Release Date**: June 10, 2020

### Resolved Issues

This release fixes the following issues:

* Upgrading a replicated tile no longer fails with the error `this migration in a replicated tile caused the
error "TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of undefined".`
* BOSH deployment does not fail anymore when the RabbitMQ admin password for the pre-provisioned cluster
contains a special character, such as `$`.
* To prevent `rabbitmqctl node_health_check` timing out after 70 seconds, RabbitMQ performs less intrusive
health checks.
For more information, see the [RabbitMQ documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/monitoring.html#health-checks).

### Known Issues

## <a id="1-19-0"></a> v1.19.0

**Release Date**: May 15, 2020

### Features

New features in this release:

* **RabbitMQ Prometheus plugin support:** This plugin collects RabbitMQ node metrics that you can use for
monitoring.
To enable this feature, you must open port `15692`. <br><br>
For information about the RabbitMQ Prometheus plugin, see the
[RabbitMQ documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/prometheus.html).<br>
For more information about enabling this feature,
see [Required Networking Rules for On-Demand Services](./about.html#network-rules).

* **Service-Gateway Improvement:** Operators can configure an on-demand plan that enables service
instances to connect to components outside the <%= vars.platform_name %> foundation through MQTT and STOMP.
For more information, see [Enabling Service-Gateway Access](./enable-service-gateway.html).

* **Filter metrics by cluster names:** The RabbitMQ cluster name now matches its service instance GUID,
enabling operators to filter metrics by cluster names.

### Resolved Issues

This release fixes the following issue:

* **Quorum queue downtime during rolling upgrades:** When used in production, quorum queues no longer
experience downtime during a rolling upgrade.
This is because <%= vars.product_short %> waits for quorum and mirror-sync critical nodes to sync before upgrades.

### Known Issues

This release has the following known issues:

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + "/rabbitmq/erlang-ki" %>
* Upgrading a replicated tile fails with the error `this migration in a replicated tile caused the error
"TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of undefined".`
* In production use cases, `rabbitmqctl node_health_check` times out after 70 seconds.
