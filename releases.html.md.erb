## <a id="upgrade"></a> Upgrade to the Latest Version

Pivotal recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line,
then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line.
For example, if you use an older v1.14.x version,
upgrade to the latest v1.14.x version before upgrading to the latest v1.15.x version.

For product versions and upgrade paths,
see the [Product Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf).

## <a id="deprecation"></a> Pivotal Is Continuing Support for the Pre-Provisioned Service

<%= vars.note_pre_provisioned %>

For information about migrating from the pre-provisioned service to the on-demand
service, see
[About Migrating a Pre-Provisioned Instance to an On-Demand Instance](./ondemand.html#migrating-from-mt).
For instructions on how to install, configure, and deploy RabbitMQ for PCF
as an on-demand service, see <a href="./install-config.html">

## <a id="1161"></a> v1.16.1

**Release Date**: April 26, 2019

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong>
To fix CVE-2018-1279, the method used to generate the Erlang cookie has changed in RabbitMQ for PCF v1.16.
For more information about this security issue, see
<a href="https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-1279">CVE-2018-1279: RabbitMQ cluster compromise due to deterministically generated cookie</a>.
<br><br>
If you rely on the tile to generate the cookie by leaving the Erlang cookie field
blank, you will experience a few minutes of downtime when you upgrade.
For more information, see <a href="./install-config-pp.html#security-fix">Erlang Cookie Security Fix</a>.
<br><br>
If you have set the cookie explicitly in the tile configuration, you are not
affected by this issue or this change.</p>

### Security Fixes

This release includes the following security fix:

* High [CVE-2018-1279: RabbitMQ cluster compromise due to deterministically generated cookie](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-1279)

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* You can enable the `rabbitmq_event_exchange` and the `rabbitmq_mqtt` plugins
  for on-demand service instances.
  These plugins are disabled by default.
  For how to do this, see [Disabled RabbitMQ Server Plugins](./install-config.html#disabled-plugins).

* You can now configure your RabbitMQ tile to share metrics with the [PCF Healthwatch service](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch/index.html).

* You can now disable service metrics for RabbitMQ instances in order to reduce operational costs.

* A checkbox on the plan configuration page lets you specify that the plan is a paid-type plan.
  In previous versions, all RabbitMQ for PCF plans were marked as free in the Marketplace.
  For information about how to mark that a plan is a paid plan,
  see [Configure the Service Plan](install-config.html#service-plan).

* Configuring TLS on RabbitMQ services has been made simpler, and is now possible at service create time, in addition to updating an existing service.
  For more information, see [Enable TLS for Your Service Instance](./use.html#tls).

* Service bindings now return DNS names instead of IP addresses. To see how this affects the RabbitMQ clients used by apps, see [RabbitMQ Node Address Resolution](./use.html#bosh-dns).

* Operators may now enforce TLS connections for all connections to on-demand RabbitMQ nodes on a deployment. For more information, see [Installing the On-Demand Service](install-config.html#security).

### Resolved Issues

This release fixes the following issues:

* Cluster scaling no longer requires downtime because the Erlang cookie is
generated using a different method.

### Known Issues

This release has the following known issues:

* Changing the Erlang Cookie value requires cluster downtime, and can result in
failed deployments.
For more information about this issue, see [Changing the Erlang Cookie Value Known Issue](./install-config-pp.html#changing-issue).

### Packages

* [OSS RabbitMQ v3.7.14](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.7.14)
* Erlang v20.3.8.20
* HAProxy v1.8.19
