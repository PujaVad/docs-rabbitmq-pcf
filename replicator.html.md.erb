title: Isolating Clusters with the RabbitMQ for VMware Tanzu [VMs] Replicator
owner: Services

<div class="note"><strong>Note: </strong><%= vars.note_pre_provisioned %></div>

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

<%= vars.product_full %> Replicator is a tool that allows you to install multiple <%= vars.product_short %> tiles
in a single <%= vars.ops_manager_full %> environment.
This lets you run multiple pre-provisioned RabbitMQ clusters that are isolated from each other.

For example, you may want to isolate the cluster serving Spring Cloud Services (SCS) from the cluster serving apps in the Marketplace.
Or you may want to give a certain team their own dedicated, pre-provisioned cluster that you manage for them.
For information on how to accomplish these scenarios, see [Common Use Cases](#usecases).

### <a id="usecases"></a> Common Use Cases

The image below illustrates how to isolate SCS on <%= vars.product_short %> from clustered and single node service instances dedicated to different teams.
In this use case:

* The unreplicated <%= vars.product_short %> tile deploys two types of services: <br>
	* A pre-provisioned service is used as a backing service for SCS <br>
	* An on-demand service is used to create three completely isolated single node service instances
* Two replica tiles are used to create two dedicated pre-provisioned clusters, with each one dedicated to a specific team.

These scenarios are explained below in [Running SCS on a Dedicated RabbitMQ Cluster](#scs-isolation) and [Providing a Pre-Provisioned Dedicated Cluster](#dedicated).

### <a id="scs-isolation"></a> Running SCS on a Dedicated RabbitMQ Cluster

Replica RabbitMQ tiles cannot be used to provide a backing service for Spring Cloud Services (SCS) because SCS expects that
the service is called `p-rabbitmq`.
Therefore, if you want to isolate the RabbitMQ cluster that is used by SCS from other tenants,
you can reserve the unreplicated <%= vars.product_short %> tile for SCS, as shown in the diagram below.
You can then add replica RabbitMQ clusters for use by apps in the Marketplace.

Pivotal recommends that you use the unreplicated <%= vars.product_short %> tile solely for SCS to avoid contention between apps
using SCS, and apps using <%= vars.product_short %> in the Marketplace.

To reserve the unreplicated tile for SCS, turn off the **Broker Registrar** errand to prevent the
broker from being exposed in the Marketplace.
For more information, see [Errands](./install-config.html#errands).

To offer RabbitMQ as a cloud messaging service in the Marketplace, create one or several replicas,
install them in <%= vars.ops_manager %>, and either allow the broker registrar errand to run, or
[register the service manually using CF](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/services/managing-service-brokers.html#register-broker).

### <a id="dedicated"></a> Providing a Pre-Provisioned Dedicated Cluster

To reserve a RabbitMQ cluster for use by a specific team,
disable the **Broker Registrar** errand in <%= vars.ops_manager %>.
This prevents service registration in the Marketplace.
For more information, see [Errands](./install-config.html#errands).

After you deploy the tile, manually expose the service broker to your desired orgs and spaces.
For instructions, see [Register a Broker](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/services/managing-service-brokers.html#register-broker).

### <a id="on-demand"></a> Using Replicas While Offering the On-Demand RabbitMQ Service

The On-Demand service is not offered in replica tiles, since the purpose of the replicator is
to create additional pre-provisioned clusters. If you wish to offer on-demand service plans,
use the unreplicated <%= vars.product_short %> tile as shown in the diagram above.

### <a id="blue-green"></a> Blue-Green Upgrades (Advanced)

In order to do blue-green style upgrades to minimize downtime, you can stand up a new cluster
and migrate data and users over to the new cluster over a period of time.
Speak with your Platform Architect about how to enable this workflow.



## <a id="generate"></a> Generating Replica Tiles

This topic describes how to install the replicator and generate replica tiles of <%= vars.product_short %>.

### <a id="prereqs"></a> Prerequisites

* <%= vars.product_short %> v1.8.x or v1.9.x
* 2.5 GB of free disk space

### <a id="download"></a> Download the Replicator

The <%= vars.product_short %> Replicator is currently available from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io). Search for and download this archive, and then run the enclosed binary.

### <a id="replica"></a> Generate Replica Tiles

The following is the syntax for generating a replica tile:

```mac
./rabbitmq-replicator-darwin\
--name YOUR-DESIRED-TILE-NAME\
--path PATH-TO-TILE\
--output DESIRED-FILE-NAME.pivotal
```

The following are the parameters expected in the above syntax:

| **Parameter** | **Description**                                                                                                                                   |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`     | The desired unique identifier for the replica tile, which is used to generate manifests, deployment names, and Marketplace name for the service. Only alphanumeric characters and `-` are accepted by the tool. |
| `path`     | The location of the original, unreplicated, <%= vars.product_short %> source tile that you downloaded                                                                                                         |
| `output`   | The desired file name and path for the replica tile                                                                                              |


### <a id="naming"></a> Naming Conventions in Original and Replica Tiles

The table below shows the naming conventions for various components related to the original <%= vars.product_short %> tile and to the replica tile.

For the purposes of this example, assume that when you generate a replica tile as shown above, in the `name` field you provide the string `finance\`. Then the attributes for the original and replica tiles are as follows:

| **Component**                              | **Name with Original Tile**                         | **Name with Replica Tile**                              |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Broker name                            | p-rabbitmq                               | p-rabbitmq-finance                               |
| Broker URL                             | pivotal-rabbitmq-broker.YOUR\_CF\_DOMAIN | pivotal-rabbitmq-broker-finance.YOUR\_CF\_DOMAIN |
| Service name                    | p-rabbitmq                               | p-rabbitmq-finance                               |
| URL for the RabbitMQ Management UI | pivotal-rabbitmq.YOUR\_CF\_DOMAIN        | pivotal-rabbitmq-finance.YOUR\_CF\_DOMAIN        |
| Tile display name in <%= vars.ops_manager %>                     | RabbitMQ                                 | RabbitMQ (finance)                               |
| Tile name used internally by <%= vars.ops_manager %>                             | p-rabbitmq                               | p-rabbitmq-finance                               |
| Metrics/Logging Origin                 | p-rabbitmq                               | p-rabbitmq-finance                               |



## <a id="install"></a> Installing Replica Tiles

After you have generated a replica tile, you can upload it to <%= vars.ops_manager %> as you would any other tile.
After you have uploaded it, follow the instructions for [Installing and Configuring <%= vars.product_short %> as a
Pre-Provisioned Service](./install-config-pp.html).
The On-Demand service is not offered on replica tiles.

## <a id="org-access"></a> Limiting Access to Replica Tiles to Specific Orgs

When you replicate <%= vars.product_short %>, the replica tile has the **Broker Registrar** errand set to **On** by default.
This field appears in the **Errands** tab in the tile:
<br><br>![registrar_errand](/images/broker_registrar_errand.png)

With any tile, if the **Broker Registrar** errand is set to **On**, it runs automatically when you finish installing the tile
and causes the tile to be available to all CF orgs.

If you want to limit access to the tile to a specific org, follow these steps:

1. Set the broker registrar errand to **Off**, and apply your changes.

1. Manually register the tile with a specific CF org using the following command.
   See the above table for `BROKER_NAME`, `BROKER_URL`, and `SERVICE_NAME`:

	```
	cf create-service-broker BROKER_NAME BROKER_USERNAME BROKER_PASSWORD BROKER_URL
	```

1. To give access to the org, use the following command and repeat for each additional org:

	```
	cf enable-service-access SERVICE_NAME -o ORG_NAME
	```

## <a id="upgrading"></a> Upgrading Replica Tiles

You can upgrade replica tiles like regular tiles with one important difference.
You must generate a replica of the newer version of the <%= vars.product_short %> tile, using the replicator,
and give the new replica the same `name` as the existing replica.
This is shown in the example workflow below.

### Example of an In-Place Upgrade of a Replica

Suppose you used the replicator to generate a replica of v1 of the <%= vars.product_short %> tile,
with the `name` **trading-team**, and you installed it in <%= vars.ops_manager %>.
Here is the sample replicator command you used for the initial installation:

```mac
./rabbitmq-replicator-darwin\
--name trading-team\
--path /download/p-rabbitmq-v1.pivotal\
--output /output/p-rabbitmq-v1-trading-team.pivotal
```

To upgrade to v2, follow these steps:

1. Download and unzip the new <%= vars.product_short %> Tile Replicator from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-rabbitmq/).
You must download the version of Tile Replicator that corresponds with the
version of the <%= vars.product_short %> Tile you want to replicate.

1. Find the plan UUID and Service UUID for the service plan you want to update.<br>
To do this, you can use the CF API. Run the following command, then search the
result for the section about the service plan you want:

    ```
    cf curl /v2/service_plans
    ```
<br>
    The result is similar to the following, with some extra properties:

    <pre class="terminal">
      {
         "metadata": {
            "guid": "a0a2fae9-e5de-47f5-b2b3-23cf07ff6142",
         },
         "entity": {
            "name": "single-node",
            "service_guid": "3e3a9413-50bd-4c76-a226-8721b0d2b3d7",
         }
      }
    </pre>
    - The plan UUID is found under `metadata`, `guid`.
    - The service UUID is found under `entity`, `service_guid`.

1. Run the replicator command below to create the replica:

    ```mac
      ./rabbitmq-replicator-darwin\
      --name NAME-OF-EXISTING-REPLICA \
      --path PATH-TO-NEW-TILE \
      --plan-uuid PLAN-UUID \
      --service-uuid SERVICE-UUID \
      --output /output/p-rabbitmq-v2-trading-team.pivotal
    ```
    Where:<br>
      - `NAME-OF-EXISTING-REPLICA` must be the same as the name used for the existing replica.
      This is **trading-team** in this example.
      - `PATH-TO-NEW-TILE` is the path to the new <%= vars.product_short %> v2 tile.
      - `PLAN-UUID` is the plan UUID found in Step 2.
      - `SERVICE-UUID` is the service UUID found in Step 2.

    Specifying the parameters `--plan-uuid` and `--service-uuid` ensures the new
    replica updates the existing service offering and plans.

1. After you have the replica tile **p-rabbitmq-v2-trading-team.pivotal**, upload it to <%= vars.ops_manager %>.
This upgrades the v1 replica tile in place.




You can then proceed with upgrading the cluster.
