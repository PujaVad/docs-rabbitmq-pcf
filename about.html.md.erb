This topic describes the architecture for on-demand RabbitMQ&reg; for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

For information about architecture of the older, pre-provisioned service, see [Deploying the RabbitMQÂ® Service](./deploying.html).

## <a id="service-network"></a>Service Network Requirement

<%# The below partial is in https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-partials %>

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/services/service-networks-v3', :locals => {
  :platform_name => vars.platform_old} %>

## <a id ="architecture_networks"></a>Default Network and Service Network

<%# The below partial is in https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-partials %>

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/services/on_demand_architecture', :locals => {
  :product_short => "RabbitMQ for PCF"} %>


## <a id="network-rules"></a>Required Networking Rules for On-Demand Services

<%# The below partial is in https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-partials %>

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/services/service_networks_table', :locals => {
  :platform_name => vars.platform_old,
	:app_runtime_full => vars.app_runtime_full,
	:product_short => "RabbitMQ"} %>

Regardless of the specific network layout, the operator must ensure network
rules are set up so that connections are open as described in the table below.
