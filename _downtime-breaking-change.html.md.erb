<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change: </strong>
Upgrading to this RabbitMQ for PCF release causes cluster <strong>downtime</strong>.
This is because the RabbitMQ cluster is taken offline when nodes are upgraded to Erlang v21.
<br><br>
Instead of upgrading to this release, Pivotal recommends upgrading to RabbitMQ for PCF v1.17.3 or later.
Upgrading to RabbitMQ for PCF v1.17.3 or later uses rolling upgrades.
This does not take the cluster offline when nodes are upgraded to Erlang v21.
