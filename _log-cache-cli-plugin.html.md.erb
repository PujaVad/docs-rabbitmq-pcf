To access metrics for <%= service_name %> service instances, you can use Loggregator's Log
Cache feature with the Log Cache CLI plugin.
Log Cache is enabled by default in  Pivotal Application Service v2.2 and later.

To access metrics for on-demand service instances, do the following:

1. To install the cf CLI plugin, run the following command:

    ```
    cf install-plugin -r CF-Community "log-cache"
    ```

1. To access metrics for a service instance, run the following command:

    ```
    cf tail SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME
    ```
    Where `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` is the name of your service instance.
    <br><br>
  For example:
  <pre>
     $ cf tail my-instance
     Retrieving logs for service my-instance in org system / space pivotal-services as admin...
     2018-12-06T11:01:06.03+0000 [my-instance] GAUGE /p.rabbitmq/rabbitmq/channels/count:0.000000 count /p.rabbitmq/rabbitmq/connections/count:0.000000...
    </pre>
