## <a id="rbac"></a>Role-Based Access in <%= vars.ops_manager_full %>

<%= vars.ops_manager %> administrators can use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage which
operators can make deployment changes, view credentials, and manage user roles in <%= vars.ops_manager %>.
Therefore, your role permissions might not permit you to perform every procedure in this operator guide.

For more information about roles in <%= vars.ops_manager %>, see
    <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/config-rbac.html#about">
        Understand Roles in <%= vars.ops_manager %></a>.</p>


## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites for Deploying the On-Demand Service

Before deploying <%= vars.product_name %> as an on-demand service, ensure the following:

*  <strong>Networking:</strong> You must ensure that the required network rules are in place to allow various components to communicate.
See [Required Networking Rules for On-Demand Services](about.html#network-rules)
for details on the network connections that must be open to enable the on-demand service.

* <strong>Transport Layer Security (TLS):</strong> If you want to use TLS to secure communication between apps and RabbitMQ service instances,
you must complete the procedures in [Provide or Generate a CA Certificate](./prepare-tls.html#provide-generate-pcf) before installing and configuring the tile.

## <a id="install"></a> Download and Install <%= vars.product_name %>

1. Download the product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-rabbitmq-service/).

2. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

3. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to the version number of <%= vars.product_name %>. This adds the tile to your staging area.

4. Click the newly added **<%= vars.product_name %>** tile.
This lets you begin configuring the tile. The installation is complete when you apply the changes from the configuration.

## <a id="tile_configurations"></a> Configure On-Demand <%= vars.product_name %>

The configuration screen below appears when you click the <%= vars.product_name %> tile in <%= vars.ops_manager %>.
An orange circle indicates that you are required to configure fields on the tab before you can deploy the tile.
A green checkmark indicates that the tab is preconfigured and you may optionally change its settings.

### <a id="azs-networks"></a> Configure AZs and Networks

 Follow the steps below to configure the AZs and networks.

 1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.
     <p class="note warning"><strong>Important</strong>: You cannot change the regions or networks after you have clicked **Apply Changes** in the [Apply Changes from Your Configuration](#apply-changes) below.</p>

 2. Configure the fields on the **Assign AZs and Networks** as follows:
   <table>
     <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
     <tr><td><strong>Place singleton jobs in</strong></td>
         <td>Select the region that you want for singleton VMs. <%= vars.platform_name %> creates the RabbitMQ broker in this AZ.</td></tr>
     <tr><td><strong>Balance other jobs in</strong></td>
         <td>Select additional region. This selection does not affect the on-demand <%= vars.product_name %> service.</td></tr>
     <tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td>
         <td>Select a network for the RabbitMQ On-Demand Broker.<br><br>
             This should be a separate network from the one you select for <strong>Service Network</strong>.
             For more information about the Default Network, see <a href="./about.html#on-demand">Default Network and Service Network</a>.<br><br>
             Typically, you select the network used for <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> components.
         </td></tr>
     <tr><td><strong>Service Network</strong></td>
         <td> Select a separate network that the on-demand service instances run on.<br><br>
              A typical practice is to put all on-demand services on a single network, separate from the network that <%= vars.app_runtime %> and the On-Demand Broker run on.
              For information about the Service Network, see <a href="./about.html#on-demand">Default Network and Service Network</a>.<br><br>
              This field is also required for the pre-provisioned service, though in that case, it doesn't matter which network you select.</td></tr>
   </table>

    <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Changing the Network or Service Network
       after you have configured them or changing their IP configurations
       results in a failed deployment.
       For more information, see <a href="./changing-ips.html">Changing Network or IP Addresses Results in a Failed Deployment</a>.</p>

 3. Click **Save**.

        Set the value lower than this limit to avoid over-saturating BOSH.</td>
      </tr>

    </table>

1. Click **Save**.

### <a id="security"></a> Configure Security

<%= vars.product_name %> lets you use Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure communication between apps and RabbitMQ service instances.

To configure the TLS settings, do the following:

<ol>
  <li>Ensure that you have performed the procedures in <a href="./prepare-tls.html#provide-generate-pcf">Provide or Generate a CA Certificate</a> before configuring the tile and applying changes.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Security for On-Demand Plans</strong> tab.</li>

  <img src="images/security.png" alt="Security for On-Demand Plans tab">

  <li>Under <strong>TLS Options</strong>, select either <strong>Optional</strong> or <strong>Enforced</strong>. <strong>Optional</strong> enables developers to configure their RabbitMQ service instances to use TLS. <strong>Enforced</strong> requires TLS to be enabled.</li>

<p class='note breaking'><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> If TLS is set to <strong>Enforced</strong> then all existing service instances use TLS after changes from the <strong>Upgrade All Service Instances</strong> errand are applied. Any apps not using TLS are no longer able to communicate with their service instances. Such apps require a new binding and must be configured to communicate with their RabbitMQ service instance through TLS.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When TLS is subsequently set to <strong>Not Configured</strong>, existing service instances continue to use TLS. However, new instances are not configured with TLS.</p>

  <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>

  <li>Click <strong>Review Pending Changes</strong>. For more information about this <%= vars.ops_manager %> page, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/review-pending-changes.html">Reviewing Pending Product Changes</a>.</li>

  <li>In the Installation Dashboard, ensure the <strong>Upgrade All Service Instances</strong> errand is set to <strong>On</strong>, and then click <strong>Apply Changes</strong>.</li>

  <li>After deploying the tile, app developers can configure their service instances to use TLS. For developer instructions, see <a href="use.html#tls">Enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) for Your Service Instance</a>. <%# (and <a href="modify-apps-tls.html">Modifying Apps for TLS</a>.) %></li>
</ol>

### <a id="service-plan"></a> Configure the Service Plan

To enable the on-demand service, you must configure at least one on-demand plan.

* You can configure up to five on-demand plans: **On Demand Instance: Plan 1 -- On Demand Instance: Plan 5**.
* All on-demand plans can be configured to have 1, 3, 5, or 7 RabbitMQ nodes.
* If the on-demand service is not enabled, the on-demand broker is deployed alongside the RabbitMQ installation, but it is not available in the Marketplace.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must fully configure <strong>On Demand Instance: Plan 1</strong> even if you disable access to this plan (see <strong>CF Service Access</strong> in the table below).</p>


1. Choose the on-demand service instance you want to configure:<br><br>**On Demand Instance: Plan 1** (complete required fields even if you disable this plan):

    ![service-plan-1-tab](images/plan-1-configuration.png)

    **On Demand Instance: Plan 2, 3, 4, and 5**:

    ![service-plan-2-tab](images/plan-2-configuration.png)

2. Configure the fields as follows:
  <table>
    <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Enable This Plan</strong></strong></td>
        <td>(Plans 2 - 5 only) To enable, select **Plan Enable**.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>CF Service Access</strong></strong></td>
    <td>Enable or disable access to this plan, or leave access unchanged.<br><br>
        If you enable Plan 1, the default setting for Plans 2 - 5 is **Enable Service Access**.
        If you change this default setting, the smoke tests fail.
        Therefore, if you enable Plan 1 and want to change this default, before doing so, set the **On-Demand Instance Smoke Tests** errand to **Off**.
        For more information, see the [Errands](#errands) section below.<br>
      <br><ul>
        <li>**Enable Service Access**---Gives access to all orgs, and displays the service plan to all developers in the Marketplace.
        </li>
        <li>**Disable Service Access**---Disables access to all orgs, and hides the service plan to all developers in the Marketplace. This setting cannot be selected at a later time in the UI.
        </li>
        <li>**Leave Service Access Unchanged**---Keeps any existing access settings, and only displays the service plan in the Marketplace to members of orgs that have access to the plan. You can change the access settings later using the cf CLI. For instructions, see [Controlling Access to Service Plans by Org](./control-access.html).
        </li>
      </ul></td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Plan Name</strong></td>
        <td>Accept the default or enter a name. This is the name that appears in the Marketplace.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Plan Description</strong></td>
        <td>Accept the default or enter a description.  This description appears in the Marketplace.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Paid Plan</strong></td>
        <td>Enable this checkbox to indicate that this service plan is paid.
            The plan is marked with an asterisk in the <code>cf marketplace</code> list and
            labeled <code>paid</code> in the <code><strong>free or paid</strong></code> column when individual plans are listed.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Plan Features</strong></td>
        <td>Accept the default or enter a description.  This description appears in Apps Manager.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Plan Quota</strong></td>
        <td>Enter the maximum number of on-demand service instances that can be available at one time. For more information, see [Setting Limits for On-Demand Service Instances](./set-quotas.html).</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Number of Nodes</strong></strong></td>
        <td>Enter 1, 3, 5 or 7. This setting only affects new service instances.
            Previously deployed service instances are **not** updated.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Network Partition Behaviour</strong></strong></td>
        <td>Select <code>pause_minority</code> or <code>autoheal</code>. Pivotal recommends using pause minority.
            For more information, see <a href="./ondemand.html#tradeoff">Consistency or Availability Tradeoff</a>.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>RabbitMQ VM Type</strong></td>
        <td>Select a large VM type. The plan creates a service instance of this size. For more information, see <a href="#resources">About RabbitMQ VM Types and Persistent Disk Size</a> below. </td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Persistent Disk Type</strong></td>
    <td>This is where RabbitMQ pages messages to disk.
    Service instance deployments fail if this value is less than twice the volume of RAM of the selected RabbitMQ VM Type.
    For more information, see <a href="#resources">About RabbitMQ VM Types and Persistent Disk Size</a> below.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>AZ Placement</strong></td>
    <td>This field is available after you complete the Assign AZs and Networks page. See the [Assign AZs and Networks](#azs-networks) section above for more information.
        <ul><li>For a single-node plan, select one or more AZs.</li>
          <li>For a plan containing multiple nodes, select only one AZ.
        Pivotal recommends this for multi-node plans to minimize risks due to network latency and partitions. See <a href="./ondemand.html#latency">Network Latency</a> and <a href="./ondemand.html#tradeoff">Consistency or Availability Tradeoff</a> for details.
        <br><br>If you change this selection after deployment, existing instances are not affected by the change. See [Determine which AZs a Service Instance Uses](#determineaz) below for more information.</li>
      </ul></td></tr>
  </table>


3. Click **Save**.

#### <a id="determineaz"></a> Determine which AZs a Service Instance Uses

<p class='note warning'><strong>Important</strong>: If you change this configuration after you have selected AZs and deployed service instances, existing instances are not placed in the newly configured AZs when the Upgrade All Service Instances or Recreate All Service Instances errands are run. This prevents re-creation of the VMs in different AZs, which could lead to data loss.
<br>All new service instances, however, are created in the newly configured AZs.</p>

<br>To determine which AZs a service instance is placed in, do one of the following:

<ul><li>Retrieve the service GUID using the <code>cf service SERVICE_INSTANCE --guid</code> command
       and then run the BOSH <code>instances</code> command for the <code>service-instance_GUID</code> deployment.</li>

  <li>With syslog forwarding enabled, inspect the service broker logs
          when running the <strong>Upgrade All Service Instances</strong> errand. For each existing service instance, the log message includes the service instance GUID and the AZs the service instance is running in.</li>
</ul>


#### <a id="resources"></a> RabbitMQ VM Types and Persistent Disk Size

The **RabbitMQ VM Type** and **Persistent disk type** are required fields on the service plan configuration pages.
If you are installing on <%= vars.platform_name %>, these properties are pre-configured by default.

<%= image_tag("images/vm-ram-disk-example.png", :width => "400") %>

Pivotal recommends that the value of **Persistent disk type** be twice the amount of RAM of the selected **RabbitMQ VM Type**.

* You can change the RabbitMQ VM type and the size of the persistent disk that is attached to the RabbitMQ instances.
  For example, if you are running out of disk space you might want to increase the persistent disk size
  by changing the **Persistent disk type** field.
  If you make changes, ensure that the persistent disk size is still twice the size of the RAM of the RabbitMQ VM type.

* RabbitMQ raises alarms when disk space drops below the configured limit.
Incorrect disk sizes might cause the deployed instance not to start.
RabbitMQ declines to start if there is not enough space available according to the threshold.

* On-Demand instances are configured with a threshold set to the 150% of the RAM of the VM.
Use the following table as a guide when selecting the size of the persistent disk.

The following table shows an example of possible RAM values, absolute minimal value below which
RabbitMQ declines to start, and the disk size suggested for an average use case.

<table border="1" class="nice">
  <tr>
    <th>RAM</th>
    <th>Free disk alarm threshold (1.5 x RAM)</td>
    <th>Suggested disk size (2 x RAM)</th>
  <tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10&nbsp;GB</td>
    <td>15&nbsp;GB</td>
    <td>20&nbsp;GB</td>

  <tr>
  <tr>
    <td>32&nbsp;GB</td>
    <td>48&nbsp;GB</td>
    <td>64&nbsp;GB</td>
  <tr>
</table>

Minimum resources required for each RabbitMQ VM:

- CPU: 2
- RAM: 1&nbsp;GB
- Ephemeral disk: 2&nbsp;GB
- Persistent disk: 4&nbsp;GB

### <a id="stemcell"></a> Verify the Stemcell

To verify that you have the correct stemcell, follow the procedure in
[Importing and Managing Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/managing-stemcells.html).


### <a id="apply-changes"></a> Apply Changes from Your Configuration

Your installation is not complete until you apply your configuration changes. Follow the steps below:

1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
For more information about this <%= vars.ops_manager %> page,
see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).

1. Click **Apply Changes** to complete the installation of <%= vars.product_name %>.

## <a id='errands'></a>Errands

When deploying or updating <%= vars.product_name %>, <%= vars.ops_manager %> can optionally run a
series of [Post-Deploy Errands](#post-deploy-errands), detailed in the section below.
An example is the `Smoke Tests` errand, which checks the health of the RabbitMQ
cluster after a deploy or upgrade.

You can toggle errands on and off on the **Review Pending Changes** page.

![Configuring One-time Errands](images/errands-installation-pending-changes.png)

<p class='note warning'><strong>Warning:</strong> In <%= vars.product_name %> v1.9.0 and later,
  post-deploy errands are on by default except for the Recreate All Service Instances errand.
  Pivotal recommends keeping these defaults, because the smoke tests can encounter
  unexpected issues, and on-demand instances of <%= vars.product_name %> might fall behind
  if the Upgrade All Service Instances errand is not on by default.</p>

You can change these defaults by clicking **Errands** in the <%= vars.product_name %>
**Settings** tab as well as the defaults for [pre-delete](#pre-delete-errands) errands.

For more information on errand run rules, see [Errand Run Rules](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/managing_errands.html#rules).

<%= vars.product_name %> errands are co-located with their brokers to decrease errand run time and VM footprint.
In earlier releases, a new VM was deployed for each errand.
For more information about errands, see [Errands](http://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html).

## <a id="admin-service-key"></a>Create an Admin User for a Service Instance

If you want to give app developers admin privileges to the RabbitMQ Management UI, you can create an admin user for a service instance and share the user credentials with app developers.

Both operators and app developers can use this procedure.

To create an admin user on a RabbitMQ instance do the following:

1. Run this command to create a service key:

    ```
    cf create-service-key SERVICE_INSTANCE SERVICE_KEY -c '{"tags": "administrator"}'
    ```

    <br>Where:
    * `SERVICE_INSTANCE` is the name you supplied when you ran `cf create-service`
    * `SERVICE_KEY` is a name you choose to identify the service key

    <br>For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf create-service-key my-instance my-admin-key -c '{"tags":"administrator"}'<br>
    Creating service key my-admin-key for service instance my-instance as user<span>@</span>example.com...
