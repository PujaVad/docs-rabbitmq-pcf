This topic lists frequently asked questions that apply to the <%= vars.product_full %> pre-provisioned service.


## <a id="faq"></a> Frequently Asked Questions

### <a id="check-deploy"></a> What should I check before deploying a new version of the tile?

Ensure that all nodes in the cluster are healthy through the RabbitMQ Management UI, or health
metrics exposed by the firehose.
You cannot rely solely on the BOSH `instances` output as that reflects the state of the Erlang VM
used by RabbitMQ and not the RabbitMQ application.


### <a id="stopstart"></a>  What is the correct way to stop and start <%= vars.product_full %>?

Only BOSH commands should be used by the operator to interact with the RabbitMQ app.

There are BOSH job lifecycle hooks which are only fired when rabbitmq-server is
stopped through BOSH. You can also stop individual instances by running the stop command and
specifying `JOB [index]`.

Before introducing you to the bosh commands, you need to know that there is a peculiarity when stopping the full cluster. Nodes need to be started in reverse order they were shutdown. When you do `bosh stop rabbitmq-server`, bosh stops rabbitmq-server/0, rabbitmq-server/1 and then rabbitmq-server/2. You can't then use `bosh start rabbitmq-server`because this will try to start rabbitmq-server/0 first (it always starts with job index 0), but this node, since it wasn't the first one it was stopped, will wait until the first one that was stopped starts. This will never happen because bosh starts the nodes sequencially and won't go to the others node until this is started. The correct way to start the nodes will be to starts the instances individually specifying the job index. This is `bosh start rabbitmq-server/2`, `bosh start rabbitmq-server/1` and `bosh start rabbitmq-server/0`

The other option can be to stop the nodes indivually as follows, `bosh stop rabbitmq-server/2`, `bosh stop rabbitmq-server/1` and `bosh stop rabbitmq-server/0` and then use `bosh start rabbitmq-server` that will start the nodes from index 0 to 2.

Finally, you can stop and start the nodes individually, making sure the order rule is followed.

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>Do not use <code>monit stop rabbitmq-server</code> as this does not call the drain scripts</p>

### <a id="boshstop"></a> What happens when I run bosh stop rabbitmq-server?

BOSH starts the shutdown sequence from the bootstrap instance.

We start by telling the RabbitMQ application to shutdown and then shutdown the
Erlang VM within which it is running. If this succeeds, we run the following
checks to ensure that the RabbitMQ application and Erlang VM have stopped:

1. If `/var/vcap/sys/run/rabbitmq-server/pid` exists, check that the PID inside
this file does not point to a running Erlang VM process. Notice that we are
tracking the Erlang PID and not the RabbitMQ PID.
1. Check that `rabbitmqctl` does not return an Erlang VM PID

Once this completes on the bootstrap instance, BOSH will continue the same
sequence on the next instance. All remaining rabbitmq-server instances will be
stopped one by one.

### <a id="serverfailprocess"></a> What happens when bosh stop rabbitmq-server fails?

If the BOSH `stop` fails, you will likely get an error saying that the drain
script failed with:

<pre class="terminal">result: 1 of 1 drain scripts failed. Failed Jobs: rabbitmq-server.
</pre>

### <a id="serverfailactions"></a> What do I do when bosh stop rabbitmq-server fails?

The drain script logs to `/var/vcap/sys/log/rabbitmq-server/drain.log`. If you
have a remote syslog configured, this will appear as the `rmq_server_drain`
program.

First, BOSH `ssh` into the failing rabbitmq-server instance and start the
rabbitmq-server job by running `monit start rabbitmq-server`. You will not be
able to start the job via BOSH `start` as this always runs the drain script first
and will fail since the drain script is failing.

Once rabbitmq-server job is running (confirm this via `monit status`), run `DEBUG=1`
`/var/vcap/jobs/rabbitmq-server/bin/drain`. This will tell you exactly why itâ€™s
failing.

### <a id="backup"></a> How can I manually back up the state of the RabbitMQ cluster?

It is possible to back up the state of a RabbitMQ cluster for both the on-demand and pre-provisioned
services using the RabbitMQ Management API.
Backups include virtual hosts, exchanges, queues, and users.

#### Back up Manually

1. Log in to the RabbitMQ Management UI as the admin user that you created.
For instructions about how to do so with or without OAuth enabled, see
[Using the RabbitMQ Management UI](./managing.html).

1. Select **export definitions** from the main page.

#### Back up and Restore with a Script

Use the API to run scripts with code similar to the following:

1. For the backup:

    ```
    curl -u "$USERNAME:$PASSWORD" "http://$RABBIT_ADDRESS:15672/api/definitions"
    -o "$BACKUP_FOLDER/rabbit-backup.json"
    ```

2. For the restore:

    ```
    curl -u "$USERNAME:$PASSWORD" "http://$RABBIT_ADDRESS:15672/api/definitions"
    -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d
    "@$BACKUP_FOLDER/rabbit-backup.json"
    ```

### <a id="preupgrade"></a> What pre-upgrade checks should I do?

Before doing any upgrade of RabbitMQ, VMware recommends checking the following:

1. In <%= vars.ops_manager %>, check that the status of all of the instances is healthy.
1. Log in to the RabbitMQ Management UI.
For instructions about how to do so with or without OAuth enabled, see
[Using the RabbitMQ Management UI](./managing.html).
1. Check that no alarms have been triggered and that all nodes are healthy, that is,
they should display as green.
1. Check that the system is not close to hitting either the memory or disk alarm.
Do this by looking at what each node has consumed in the RabbitMQ Management UI.
